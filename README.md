GameJam Goals
=============
The goals:

1. Learn from the experience
2. Build a prototype game

GameJam Prep List
=================

Decide on your tools
--------------------
When you have to build a game in <3 days, it is very hard to make a prototype game while learning new tools.

A list of tools I would like to have when entering a gamejam include
- Flocking and Steering behaviours
- Functional Shaders (Outline objects behind walls, etc.)
- In-game Gui
- Basic Inventory
- Start/Pause Menu
- Link to your social media (twitter etc)

Build your own tools
--------------------
Game Engines have come a long way in the past 20 years.
Software builds on software.
Take your knowledge of game technologies, and look for gaps in your game engine's toolset.
Implement what you think would be most useful for speeding or simplifying the game development process.

Example: Unity Engine doesn't come with Steering behaviours built in.
Perhaps build your own Steering AI for use in Unity.

Be Prepared for Paper Prototyping
---------------------------------
Bring the Following
1. Scissors
2. Colored Markers
3. Lots of Paper
4. Pencil
5. Eraser

Brainstorming
-------------
Try to keep it to 20 Minutes.

Strategize Features
-------------------
Decide what the first parts of the game to produce are.
I suggest:
- Player controls
- Basic game environment
- At least one kind of obstacle

GameJam Group Prep
==================

Agree on a Game Engine
----------------------
A game engine is where all the resources come together to produce your game.
Almost all participants will want to have the same version of the game engine to encourage easy merging of resources.

Share your Tools
----------------
Share what tools you intend to use with the group to avoid incompatabilities. This also serves as a way for group members to learn about new and useful technologies that they are not using.

*Note: Do not let new tools distract you from the making of your game*
